# Part 1

## Hi, there. 

#### To get some easy practice with Git/GitHub, follow the directions below:

- clone this repository to your local machine 
- open it in Sublime and then open the index.html file in your browser
- follow the directions in `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` 
- commit your changes and push those changes back to this GitHub repository (I will add you as a collaborator)
- message me when you do :thumbs_up:

Google is your friend!  

The page should behave like this when you click the button:

# Part 2

## Nice job, sir. 

#### To practice branching / forking - important aspects of working with techincal SMEs - follow the directions below: 

- on your local machine, create a branch called `jeffs_branch` and in `index.html` add "This is work done from my own branch" and a funny picture of your choice - I need a good laugh so make sure it's funny!
- add, commit, and push this branch to this GitHub repository
- submit a pull request back to the master branch

If all goes well, you should see 2 branches between to the number of commits and releases as well as a single pull request on the right hand side:
