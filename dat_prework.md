## Pre-Course Checklist
Please complete the following by the first day of class. Feel free to shoot us an email with any questions:

### Introductions
1. In order for us to get to know you, please fill out this [Student Profile Survey] before the first class.
2. Please also complete this [Preliminary Skills Survey] in order to help us place you in complementary groups.

### Accounts
1. Create a Github account
2. Create a Slack / Hipchat account

### Installations
The following instructions assume you are using a Mac. If you are a Linux or PC user, please review specific instructions for your environment. If you have any problems, come to class ~30 min early on the first day and our TAs will help you get set up:

1. [ ] Install Python

                - Follow the installation instructions for Python <2.7> on your computer.
                *Note: we will be using Python <2.7>, not Python <3>.*
2. [ ] Install Package Manager

                - Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a popular package manager for OSx.
3. [ ] Install Anaconda
                - Follow the instructions [from this link](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to download and install Anaconda, a popular set of Python tools used for data science.
                - If you get stuck, try reading the [documentation](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html).
4. [ ] Test for Successful Install
                - Test that Anaconda is installed correctly by opening a Terminal window and entering:
                        '''ipython notebook'''

If successful, in a few moments, your browser should open to a window titled "Jupyter."

### Start Practicing (Optional)
Here are a few resources that will help introduce you to some commonly used syntax and tools.
